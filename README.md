# unity-cloth-init
A script for initializing Unity cloth constraints based on vertex color and/or UV position

How to:
Stick the script on a cloth mesh.
If it's attached to an animator, turn the animator off.
Also probably make sure its scale is 1. I haven't fully addressed that.

Sometimes you just gotta open it in a new scene to make it work I guess...?

# unity-cloth-init
A script for initializing Unity cloth constraints based on vertex color and/or UV position

How to:
Stick the script on a cloth mesh.
If it's attached to an animator, turn the animator off.
Also probably make sure its scale is 1. I haven't fully addressed that.
Make sure there are no colliders attached. I should address this too.
